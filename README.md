# Trending Twitter Tunes

A Python application that takes a US Twitter trending topic and finds a YouTube music video related to that topic name. 
For example, the trending topic #USMNT will be returned with this music-related clip: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0kn_t7hwC4

The Trending Twitter Tunes website displays the top 10 Twitter topics and their associated music video.
Additionally we have a Twitterbot that tweets the top Twitter trend and it's associated video once per hour:
